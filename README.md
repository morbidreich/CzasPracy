*Disclaimer - under the hood this is a piece of horribly written software. Still I decided to showcase it (together with [EFS](https://www.github.com/morbidreich/EFS)) to present my ability to deliver succesful and useful solutions in accordance with customer specifications. Also - that was 10 years ago:) If you've flown from Poland in last 10 years it's almost certain that training of controllers that were watching after your flight was assisted by my software.*
